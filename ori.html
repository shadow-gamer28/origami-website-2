      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.</li>
          <li> Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation</li>
          <li> Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food. </li>
          <li>Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up. </li>

      <p>
        <ol>
          <li> Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.</li>
          <li>Most have red-orange eyes. But occasionally cicadas have blue, white or grayish eyes. Keep on the lookout.</li>
          <li> Their short adult life is not unusual for bugs. The adult stage for many insects is only for finding a mate or moving to a new location.</li>
          <li> Their predators, or animals that will eat them, don’t know they’re coming. Lots of animals, including birds, mice and raccoons, are in for a bug surprise!</li>
